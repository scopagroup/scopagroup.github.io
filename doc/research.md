[comment]: Below, we describe different areas research the SCOPA group has contributed to.

[comment]: ## Numerical Optimization
[comment]: We developed Gauss--Newton--Krylov algorithms algorithms for large-scale optimization problems goverened by dynamical systems. We have designed different preconditioners for the reduced space Hessian system. 
[comment]: ## Parallel and Distributed Computing
[comment]: We have deployed parallel algorithms on high-performance computing platforms. The computational kernels include spectral differentiation, interpolation, and finite differences.
[comment]: ## Personalized Modeling of Tumor Growth
[comment]: We have designed different approaches for calibrating PDEs to medical imaging data.
[comment]: ## Shape Matching and Shape Classification
[comment]: We have developed methodology for shape classification and shape matching.
[comment]: ## Diffeomorphic Image Registration
[comment]: We have developed different algorithms for diffeomorphic image registration.
