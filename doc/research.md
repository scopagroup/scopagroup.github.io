# Research

Go back to [README.md](../README.md).

Below, we describe different areas research the SCOPA group has contributed to.

[comment]: <> ## Numerical Optimization

[comment]: We developed Gauss--Newton--Krylov algorithms algorithms for large-scale optimization problems goverened by dynamical systems. We have designed different preconditioners for the reduced space Hessian system. 



## Parallel and Distributed Computing

We have deployed parallel algorithms on high-performance computing platforms. The computational kernels include spectral differentiation, interpolation, and finite differences.



## Personalized Modeling of Tumor Growth

We have designed different approaches for calibrating PDEs to medical imaging data.


## Shape Matching and Shape Classification

We have developed methodology for shape classification and shape matching.


## Diffeomorphic Image Registration

We have developed different algorithms for diffeomorphic image registration.
