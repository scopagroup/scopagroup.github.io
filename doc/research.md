## Diffeomorphic Image Registration

We have developed the software tool CLAIRE for diffeomorphic image registration in 3D. CLAIRE stands for <em>Constrained Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Image Registration</em>. It is a C/C++ software package for velocity-based diffeomorphic image registration. Its performance is optimized for multi-core CPU systems (cpu branch) and multi-node, multi-GPU architectures (gpu branch; default). The CPU version uses MPI for data parallelism, and has been demonstrated to scale on several supercomputing platforms. CLAIRE can be executed on large-scale state-of-the-art computing systems as well as on local compute systems with limited resources.

CLAIRE has been released under the GNU General Public License and is avaialbe for download at [https://github.com/andreasmang/claire](https://github.com/andreasmang/claire). The deployment page is [https://andreasmang.github.io/claire](https://andreasmang.github.io/claire).
