## Overview

This is a webpage for the *Scientific Computing, Optimization, and Parallel Algorithms* (SCOPA) lab at UH's [Department of Mathematics](https://uh.edu/nsm/math). Broadly speaking, the areas of research of the SCOPA lab include the following:
* scientific computing & numerical methods
* statistical & deterministic inverse problems (governed by dynamical systems)
* numerical optimization & variational techniques
* nonlinear optimal control
* parallel & distributed-memory algorithms
* data-enabled science

SCOPA targets various applications of computational and data-enabled sciences with the ultimate aspiration to (i) aid data analysis, (ii) support decision-making, and (iii) enable model-based prediction. Follow the links below to find out more about our activities and our lab.
