This webpage showcases some of the work of the Scientific Computing, Optimization, and Parallel Algorithms (SCOPA) group at UH's [Department of Mathematics](https://uh.edu/nsm/math). Broadly speaking, the areas of research of our group include
* scientific computing and numerical methods
* inverse problems (governed by dynamical systems)
* numerical optimization and variational techniques
* nonlinear optimal control
* parallel and distributed-memory algorithms

SCOPA targets various applications of computational and data-enabled sciences with the ultimate aspiration to (i) aid data analysis, (ii) support decision-making, and (iii) enable model-based prediction. Follow the links below to find out more about our activities and our research group.
